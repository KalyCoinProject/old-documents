We get this reminder on when the wallet launches for the first time, we can decide to backup later or backup now (recommended).

Another new, cool feature about the 0.18.2 Kalycoin release is the Staking Button, it enables staking on your Kalycoin wallet by simply pressing the above button, if the wallet is encrypted, you'll be asked to unlock the wallet.

Here we unlock the wallet and decide if we want to fully unlock or unlock for staking only.
