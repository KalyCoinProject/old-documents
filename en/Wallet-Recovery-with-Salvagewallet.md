We can have a look at the data menu of Kalycoin. Open menu `%APPDATA%\Kalycoin`. **Please be careful and don't remove or change any content under this menu except you are aware of them.**

Now the old wallet has been backed up to `wallet.1516172743.bak`. The wallet is using the new `wallet.dat` file. It contains all private keys with brand new data.

After the above steps, it's better to remove the shortcut on the desktop in order not to reindex your wallet next time.
